When you turn on LIKO-12, the engine will load the BIOS configuration and initialize the peripherals, then show the POST screen giving you a little time to press Delete to enter the BIOS.

The liko12 BIOS is actually made of a host specs info screen and a code editor.
The code editor will allow you to edit the BIOS configuration; this configuration code specifies for liko12 which peripherals to load and what configuration you would use for them.
For example: Set the GPU color pallete and the screen resolution.

The default BIOS configuration boots liko12 with the following list of peripherals:
GPU: 192x128 res, pico8 color pallete, 4x5 font.
CPU: responsible for handling events.
Keyboard: Provides the keyboard input interface.
HDD: The virtual file system; 2 Drives (C, D) each one with 50 mbyte of data.

Note that the mouse is part of the GPU.

* The BIOS screen has not been programmed yet.

Then the engine looks for a file called 'boot.lua' in the C drive: this file (in DiskOS) wraps all the peripherals' APIs and makes them ready for use anywhere, and also simulates a 'require' system for handy use.
After that the boot.lua loads terminal.lua which greets you with a shell to type commands into.
