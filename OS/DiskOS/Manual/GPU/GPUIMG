* GPUIMG Format:
 
It's usually saved as .lk12 file, you have to use hdd.read and pass the data to GPU.image or GPU.imagedata.
 
The LIKO-12's GPU image format is so simple, it's consisted of a header, and data body:
 
* The header:
 
LK12;GPUIMG:%(w)x%(h);\n
The %(w) and %(h) are replaced with the image size.
 
Example:
LK12;GPUIMG;8x8;
 
* The body:
 
It contains the image data, it's made of hex digits, so every hex digit represents a color id:
012345678 9  a  b  c  d  e  f
123456789 10 11 12 13 14 15 16
 
It starts from the top left pixel and then going right in each row (horizental line), and for more readablity there is a \n at each row start.
 
Example:
(The top left pixel is color 10, the bottom right is 12, rest are 11)
LK12;GPUIMG;4x4;
\n9aaa
\naaaa
\naaaa
\naaab
 
(Or written in one line)
LK12;GPUIMG;4x4;9aaaaaaaaaaaaaab
 
Warning: do NOT add characters other than hex digits and new line character ! Or the GPU will crash when loading the image.
