You when you turn on LIKO-12, The engine will load the bios configuration and initializes the peripherals, then shows up the POST screen giving you a little time to press Delete to enter the bios.

The liko12 bios is actually made of a host specs info screen and a code editor.
The code editor will allow you to edit the bios configuration, this configuration code specifies for liko12 which peripherals to load and what configuration you would use for them,
For example: Set the GPU color pallete and the screen resolution.

The default bios configuration boots liko12 with the following list of peripherals:
GPU: 192x128 res, pico8 color pallete, 4x5 font.
CPU: responsible for handelling events.
Keyboard: Provides the keyboard input interface.
HDD: The virtual files system; 2 Drives (C, D) each one with 50 mbyte of data.

Note that the mouse is part of the GPU.

* The bios screen has been not programmed yet.

Then the engine looks for a file called 'boot.lua' in the C drive, this file (in DiskOS) wraps all the peripherals apis and make them ready for use anywhere, and also simulates a 'require' system for handy use.
After that the boot.lua loads terminal.lua which greets you with a shell to type commands in.
