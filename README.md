# About

LIKO-12 is a fantasy computer that you can use to make, play and share tiny retro-looking games and programs. It comes
with a default, fully customizable, DOS-like operating system installed, called DiskOS.

DiskOS provides an environment with basic command line programs and visual game editors.

The created games and programs are saved as disk files that can be easily shared to friends or anyone else.
